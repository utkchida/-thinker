  From My side</pre></h1>
<h2>  <pre>    Why I work on this?

    Somehow We all are a thinker,
    I made this site to tell you that don't think too much
    OK
    I know you can't stop thinking
    so do this
    "Don't Waste Your Time in Thinking but Waste Your Time in
    Planning".
    Wasting time is habit or we can say that it's nature of everyperson in this planet.
    It's started from our birth and it end at the day when we all get merged into soil.</pre></h2>
