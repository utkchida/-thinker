<h2>Most entrepreneurs get the “about me” page wrong They make one of two mistakes.
 Either…</h2>
<h4>1) They struggled for hours to talk about themselves and ended up with a brief, professional bio
 that takes 2 seconds to read, or
2) They got really into the writing process and ended up writing a long, 
winding story about their life, their struggles, their kids, and their neighbor’s grandma.
Which one are you?
If you never know what to say, I’m about to spell out exactly what your about page should include.
 And don’t worry — it’s actually not all talking about yourself!
And if you fall more into bucket #2, your story is a hugely important part of your about page —
 but I’m going to share with you some key techniques to telling that story
  in a way that draws your reader in and makes them want to work with you.
   (Because that’s the whole point of your website, isn’t it?)
Here’s how to write an about page that not only tells a compelling story,
 but also help you win new customers.</h4>
<h2>Tell them what you stand for</h2>
<h4>Why do you do what you do? What drives you to get out of bed every morning and grow your business?
You might say it’s just for profit. But come on — you could be making a profit
 by working for someone else’s company, selling all your belongings on ebay, 
 or playing with the stock market. Why do you run this business?
There’s a great guy named Simon Sinek who has the third-most watched TED Talk video
 ever and who’s really nailed down the whole blasé Harvard professor look.
  He popularized a big idea that should guide every business decision from here on out:
People don’t buy what you do.
They buy why you do it.
At the end of the day, your product or service is basically the same as 
every other product or service out there. You might differentiate yourself through low prices, 
exceptional customer care, or fancy features,
 but what’s going to actually motivate someone to buy from you over someone else?
One of your strongest differentiators is what you stand for. Tell your readers why you’re here. 
Make a bold statement.
When you let your customer into your head, when they get to understand your motivations and how you think, 
they’re going to be way more inclined to trust you.</h4>
